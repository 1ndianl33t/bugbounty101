Before we start learning how to exploit web applications, let’s talk a little about bug bounty programs. The most common question we get is “how can I continually learn after these trainings?” Our best
recommendation is to do it against real, live systems. You can do training labs all day, but without that real life experience, it’s hard to grow.

One caveat though: on average it takes about 3-6 months before you start consistently findings bugs. Our
advice: Don’t get frustrated; keep up-to-date with other bug bounty hunters; and don’t forget to check out the older programs.

$35,000 - Facebook’s software, netting a bug bounty of over $35,000
$100,000 - Bounty for detailing a bug that worked around some protections in the preview version of
Windows 8.1.
$20,000 - Shopify for Type confusion in mrb_exc_set leading to memory corruption
