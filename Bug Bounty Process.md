# Pick a target
It is recommended to pick a target that's large and old. The new programs, websites, and companies are flooded with professionals who are have more experience and have fined tuned their tools to be efficient. A company like AT&T is expected to have tens of thousands of websites, links, sub-domains, etc. A lot of their code was written without regard to security and may have been lost or undocumented. These are the targets you want to look for.
